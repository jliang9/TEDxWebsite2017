Elizabeth's research focuses on using nanotechnology platforms to understand the movement of molecules in the brain. She is particularly interested in characterizing how common disease hallmarks, such as inflammation, impaired fluid flow, and cell death, impact our ability to treat brain diseases like autism, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy. Her long term goal is to utilize nanotechnology in patients to give real-time information about the brain, and take advantage of those disease hallmarks to improve diagnosis and direct therapy."

Nikkita's idea worth spreading brings to light the power of art to make change. It has been said, \"In any war the first thing you do is kill off the poets and the philosophers...\" Why?, she asks. Because these are the inspirers, the preservers of culture and record, the communal conscious, the deep thinkers and movement starters, the light bearers, and whistleblowers. When we investigate the history of social change movements, we often find artists, poets and philosophers at the forefront. Art has the power to open hearts and minds in unsuspecting and powerful ways to create the necessary internal and external climate needed for individual and systemic social change."

After graduating from Rice University, she joined the US Peace Corps and served over two years in Benin, at which point she likes to joke that Africa got into her blood - literally and figuratively. Since then, she obtained a Master of Social Work and Master of Public Health from the University of Washington and currently serves as a faculty member at both schools. Her work at HAI focuses on strengthening public sector health systems and scaling up accessible, integrated HIV services in the northern regions of Côte d'Ivoire. Julia's TEDx talk will explore how it’s time for us to transcend the idea that technology alone is the answer in global health and discuss some innovative ways to support the human health workers that are so critical to ensuring health for all."

In addition, he created and launched the first iOS app, VitalTalk, designed to help doctors, available in the iTunes store. To disseminate this work, he launched the nonprofit VitalTalk, to take a social entrepreneurship approach to transforming the way doctors communicate."

Her amazing feat was opening Washington State’s first Adventure Playground and only the fourth Adventure Playground in the United States. In fact, her work and the Adventure Playground garnered national attention, leading to a fantastic award: KaBOOM’s Playmaker of the Month (check out http://kaboom.org/ for more information). In the fall of 2009, while employed with the City of Mercer Island Parks and Recreation Department, Ann set out to open the best playground on Mercer Island. Countless hours of research leading up to the implementation and opening of the playground painted a very scary reality of modern play - it is declining and the long term effects are huge. Ann’s TEDx talk will explore the wonders of Adventure Playgrounds and the important role they have on inspiring future innovators who could create anything from inventions that curb climate change to the stories we love to get lost in. Ann promises to make you: laugh, pause to think about the role we all have in an innovative future, and instill that our imagination gives us wings even beyond childhood."

Education transformed his life and his life’s work. During his 6 years at the UW, he continued to notice a jarring reality &ndash; people who devoted their lives to dismantling or reforming systems (racism, capitalism, imperialism, sexism, etc.) were the very ones perpetuating and reproducing them by always moving relative to them. After unsuccessful attempts at broader social change, he focused on self-development and has completely transformed his life through good thoughts, practices and ways of living based in ancient traditions such as meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Shaolin Kung Fu and Capoeira Angola Palmares. Experience Ease helps students and families use the school experience to develop more fundamental life skills. Their motto: \"we live the life we teach\" - so you know it's real."

She believes it is crucial to develop and fund effective and affordable alternatives to animal testing in order for system-wide progress to be made. Rather than pointing blame or working against one another, researchers and animal rights activists can work together to make alternatives to animal research possible, creating a win-win solution in which more effective models can be used and fewer animals harmed."
